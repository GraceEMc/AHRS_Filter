## AHRS_Filter
This repository contains new AHRS filters (different variations of JustaAHRS) and new dataset with 9-DOF inertial measurement unit (3x accelerometer, 3x magnetometer, 3x gyroscope) with VICON reference. The filter responses can be compared to the well-known methods in MATLAB gui application which is also included in repository (screen below).

The implemented optimization methods are robust against stuck in local minimums (are not so precise)
